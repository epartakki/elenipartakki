# **About Me**
I currently lead solutions engineering in EMEA and APAC for Tamr, where I help organizations across industries like healthcare, life sciences, financial services, manufacturing, and retail tackle their most complex data challenges. With a background in both computer science and political science, I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of AI and human intelligence. My research in human-machine interaction and online moderation deepened this curiosity, allowing me to explore how technology can enhance human capabilities. Today, I apply that knowledge by designing innovative data solutions that drive better decision-making across sectors.

When I'm not working, you can usually find me tinkering with gadgets and electronics, studying on new government and economic changes across the globe, reading up on the latest industry trends and technologies, exploring the great outdoors, reading about the human brain or baking. I believe that a well-rounded life is key to achieving success and happiness, and I try to balance my work and personal interests accordingly.

# **How did I end up here?**
I grew up on the island of Cyprus, in Nicosia, the last divided capital in the world. As the daughter of a farmer and grocery store worker during climate instability and droughts, making ends meet was not always easy for my family.

Widely known as the "tractor" of the neighborhood for breaking things and being very active (perhaps too active for some people in a patriarchal society), I was always supported by my family to be curious and resourceful.

At around the age of 6, I was fortunate to be passed down a computer, and my world changed. I began watching YouTube videos, learning how the internet worked, and began discovering the world of science. Simultaneously, I was very active in my community, including politics. Growing up next to so many soldiers seemed bizarre, particularly after realizing through my internet searches that maybe the rest of the world did not live like that. I began advocating for a peaceful resolution in Cyprus, and before I knew it, I was involved with the European Union and United Nations representing the youth.

Things began getting worse financially, and both my parents had faced health issues after years of trauma from experiencing war and poverty when they were kids. To help us out, I began working after school at a little tavern called "Palm Tree" (Finija in Cypriot), and then when I'd ride my bike back home at around midnight, I would sit and study for the next day. 

I was determined to make a better life for myself and my loved ones, so I worked relentlessly and became the first person in my family to go to college, receiving a full scholarship at Smith College to study Computer Science and Political Science. This was one of the largest blessings of my life. 

I've always been curious about the world and wanted to make a positive impact. Of course, this is a lighthearted highlight of my early years on earth, but I hope my story inspires you to pursue your dreams, no matter where you come from or how much money you have. Determination and hard work are irreplaceable my friend.
 
# **What is on my mind today?**
I have become fascinated with the potential of AI to revolutionize society and improve human lives. However, I also recognize the significant risks posed by powerful AI systems that could act against human interests. I am choosing to devote my free-time on research to the development of AI alignment techniques and strategies. I am conducting different independent research on topics such as value alignment, reward engineering, and cooperative AI, with a focus on ensuring that AI systems are aligned with human values and goals. As both a political science and computer science aspiring scientist, figuring out how to connect humanity and AI is of utmost importance to me, and have decided that not offering my time to aid the improvement of society, would be a life unfulfilled to me and the people I love and care about.

# Under Development

I am editing various parts of this portfolio such as the tab on my projects, past work, and curiosities. Please be patient with me while I find time to update it all.
